# Smart_Contracts_Solidity
In this project I used solidity to build smart contracts that can connect to the ethereum network. I used REMIX, which is a program that can connect to "dummy" accounts. This usage is for practice purposes only and does not execute real transations. Using REMIX allows a programmer to interact with their contracts and oversee their development.
